Currently, these screen captures are attempting to detect humans and automotive vehicles on a frame per frame basis. Obviously, false positives are common in this shortlist of images. 

haarcascade appears to be an OK classifier, but needs help. I am hoping that motion tracking algorithms or heuristics can filter out still false positives.
